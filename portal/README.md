# Pokermon

![welcome](https://github.com/jacktrusler/LIST-website/assets/89369559/2298ef09-6c88-4ce4-8ca3-bc6e2b047dc0)

A poker website built for friends that is no way affiliated with any other company or product,
despite what it may seem...

## Installation

`pnpm i`

### Why pnpm

`pnpm` is a faster version of `npm` that links packages instead of copying. Smaller node_module size
and faster installation.

### Why Vite

_Vite means Blazingly Fast_  
We wanted to separate the frontend concerns from the backend concerns while using react. A lot of
react frameworks and build tools try to have some sort of API layer or SSR, I think Vite keeps it
simple while including the latest build tools.

## Third Party Libraries

### API

- Axios
- Tanstack React-Query

### State Management

### Styling
