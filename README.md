## Welcome to Pokermon!

### Server Setup for Local Testing

`docker compose up` to build the project, the port is exposed on `7777` locally and `5000` on the server,
I only did that because `5000` sometimes has conflicts with other ports as it's a common port for development.

### Website Setup

Go into the `/portal/` directory and `pnpm i`. Then run `pnpm run dev`.
